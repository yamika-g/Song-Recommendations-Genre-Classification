# üé∂ Song Recommendations & Genre Classification

## üìå Project Overview

This project aims to explore the realm of music recommendation systems and genre classification models by analyzing the [Million Song Dataset (MSD)] (http://millionsongdataset.com/). 

This dataset, a significant resource in music data analysis, originated from an ambitious project under The Echo Nest, which was a research spin-off from the MIT Media Lab established with the goal of understanding the audio and textual content of recorded music. The Echo Nest's decade-long research culminated in its acquisition by Spotify for 50 million Euros, highlighting its profound impact. 

The Million Song Dataset also contains other datasets contributed by organisations and the community, of which 2 are important for this project: the [MSD All Music Genre Dataset (MAGD)] (https://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/mir/msd/) (containing songs and their genre labels) and the [Taste Profile Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/tasteprofile/) (containing user-song-plays).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

Skills & Concepts Used:

Python    |    PySpark    |   Statistics    |   Apache Hadoop    |   Machine Learning      


This was a University project, and the data was given as a part of the Hadoop Distributed File System.
I used python to analyze this dataset, and Jupyter Notebook as my environment. For my analysis, I used the following libraries: `pyspark`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`.
